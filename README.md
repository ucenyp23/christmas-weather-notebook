Use simple-json-db for storage and graphene-api for the API layer; run everything locally (no Docker). Provide a Node.js + Fastify backend exposing a GraphQL API (graphene-api) with auth (register/login using bcrypt + JWT stored in HttpOnly cookie), CRUD for weather notes (title, location, datetime, reported temp + unit, optional wind/precip), normalize and store temps in Celsius, compute feels-like, return clothing and walk-duration advice, and award points per note with daily bonuses and special rewards for each day Dec 1–24. Frontend: SolidJS SPA (Vite) that runs locally, supports login, note creation/editing, shows current points, daily special reward calendar (Dec 1–24), immediate feedback after note creation (points earned + advice + today's special reward), unit toggle (C/F), offline-friendly caching/queueing for notes created offline, and sync when back online. Include: local-only run instructions (npm scripts) and .env.example for JWT secret; tests for core logic (feels-like, rewards), input validation, rate-limiting middleware, and clear README with steps to run backend and frontend locally (no Docker).
